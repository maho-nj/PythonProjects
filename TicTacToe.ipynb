The aim of each player is to generate a straight line connecting three assigned symbols. The first player to achieve this goal wins the game. As such, the strateguy of this game is to build a straight line of similar symbols before the opponent even if it entails preventing the opponent from achieving this goal first. In the event of a failure to create a straight line of each symbols by the two players, the game ends with a tie.
